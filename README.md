# Plain Python-Numpy Multilayer Perceptron with Backpropagation and Momentum.

Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network With only Raw Python
This is an artifical neural network homework repo aims to help other studenst.

Our homework is generate 5 x 10 pixel black & white images and add noise and exchange some pixels.Also generating more images for test set.

After creating data we will create a multilayered backpropagation, neural network and train our data then test and graphically showing our results.

# Generate data

- [x] First generate training data x and their y_desired values and save them.
- [x] Generate test data

![training data](https://github.com/rumeysayilma/ann-hw/blob/master/images/trainin_data.jpg)

- [x] Vectorize all input x values

![vectorized training data](https://github.com/rumeysayilma/ann-hw/blob/master/images/vectorized-training-data.jpg)

## Utility Functions

- [x] Activation Func.
- [x] Error and Loss Fucntions

## Create Neural Network Class

- [/] Create a Class that handles everything in a multilayer Perceptron.
  - [ ] initialize biases and weights
  - [x] Forward Propagation
  - [/] Gradient Calculate
  - [ ] Backward Propagation
  - [ ] Training Function
    - [ ] Start with initial weights
    - [ ] go forward -> go backward -> error -> gradients -> update ->
    - [ ] Stop criteria
  - [ ] Predict Fucntion
  - [ ] Visualize
